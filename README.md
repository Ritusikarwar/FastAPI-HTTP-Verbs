# FastAPI-HTTP-Verbs
This is a beginner-friendly project built using FastAPI and SQLite that demonstrates how to perform full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on user data.  The project follows a modular structure with routers, models, and schemas separated for clean and scalable code. It uses SQLAlchemy ORM for interacting with the SQLite database.
